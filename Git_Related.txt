# Step 1: Check your existing remotes (just to confirm)
git remote -v

# Step 2: Fetch the latest changes from the public repository
git fetch upstream

# Step 3: Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Step 4: Merge changes from the public repository into your main branch
git merge upstream/main

# (Optional) Use rebase instead of merge for a cleaner history
# git rebase upstream/main

# Step 5: Push the merged/rebased changes to your private repository
git push origin main

# (If you rebased and Git prevents the push, force the push using:)
# git push origin main --force


OTHER BRANCHES:

# Step 5: Switch to your other branch
git checkout <your-branch-name>

# Step 6: Merge the updated main branch into your other branch
git merge main

# (Optional) If you prefer rebase instead of merge
# git rebase main

# Step 7: Push the updated branch to your private repository
git push origin <your-branch-name>
